## Sprint 02 Homework - SQL Database

**Prompt** : Design a restaurant database with at least 5 tables, and write CTE or subqueries to query data from the database

In this project, I created a restaurant database for “Bonnie’s Pizzeria”, a fictional homemade pizzeria that operates only on a delivery platform. Customers can place their orders and made their payments through multiple platforms that the pizzeria uses. The database created allows the pizzeria to track orders placed and payment data, this database could be used to improve the customer experience and increase sales of the restaurant.

[bonnie_pizzeria.db](bonnie_pizzeria.db) - This is SQLite database file of Bonnie’s Pizzeria.

The database will contain 6 tables including 
1. menu 
2. customers 
3. platforms 
4. orders 
5. menu_ordered 
6. payment

[bonnie_query.sql](bonnie_query.sql) - This is SQL file of queries for Bonnie’s Pizzeria database.
<br /> This file contains some SQL queries that could be used to analyze data e.g. `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `CTE` (Common table expression).

### Instruction for this project
1. Open [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/) or using software [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) to run database and queries.
2. Click `File` > `Open DB` to import `bonnie_pizzeria.db` file.
3. Click `File` > `Open SQL` to import `bonnie_query.sql` file, you could then see the queries that can work with the database.
<br /><br /> Alternatively, you can click `Import` > `Open` and then select the file you want to import to sqlite.
